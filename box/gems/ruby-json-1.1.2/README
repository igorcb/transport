JSON for Ruby is a serializer and deserializer library for JSON for Ruby
programming language.  The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight
data interchange format that is presented as an alternative to XML for
that application.  For more information on JSON, visit the JSON website at
http://www.crockford.com/JSON/index.html.

To install the library, run as root the script install.rb.

Read the RDoc documentation in ./doc for more information on the API, and
look at the unit tests in ./test for more information on how to use the
library.

Thanks to Adam Kramer for some serious changes for the better.
